# Counting-memory
The input of thecountprogramis a traceconsisting of 64-bit addresses and you are required to print out the number of uniqueaddress in the trace.

## Hash table with chaining
While keeping track of the memory, the code implements chaning to resolve hash-table collision issue.



## input format:
Thisprogramtakesafilenameasargumentfromthecommandline.Thefilecanhavefromafewlinestomillionsoflines.Eachlinecontainsanaddressinhexadecimalformat,i.e.0x7f1a91026b00,generatedbypintool(http://pintool.org). Each address is represented as a 64-bit hexadecimal number.


## Running the tests
